# CodeFly Project Documentation

## CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTIONS - READ FIRST

### Platform Name: CodeFly ‚úàÔ∏è
- **CodeFly** is the educational platform/software we are building
- This is the product name that appears in all UI, headers, and branding
- CodeFly will eventually host multiple educational games

### Current Game: Agent Academy üéÆ
- **Agent Academy** is the GAME NAME
- Agent Academy is the first game within the CodeFly platform
- The game teaches coding through a spy/agent themed adventure

### Agent Academy 8-Mission Structure:
1. **Binary Shores Academy** (Weeks 1-2) - Introduction & Setup
2. **Variable Village** (Weeks 3-4) - Data Types & Variables
3. **Logic Lake Outpost** (Weeks 5-7) - Conditionals & Boolean Logic
4. **Loop Canyon Base** (Weeks 8-10) - For/While Loops & Iteration
5. **Function Forest Station** (Weeks 11-13) - Functions & Parameters

## Project Structure

### Repository Name
- Current: `Curriculum-pilot-mvp`
- Should rename to: `codefly-platform`

### Package.json Name
- Current: `coding-pilot-mvp`
- Should be: `codefly`

## UI Text Guidelines

### Correct Usage Examples:
- ‚úÖ "Welcome to CodeFly - Learn To Code On The Fly"
- ‚úÖ "Agent Academy: Mission 1 - Binary Shores Academy"
- ‚úÖ "Begin your Agent Academy training at Binary Shores Academy"
- ‚úÖ "CodeFly presents: Agent Academy"

### Incorrect Usage (AVOID):
- ‚ùå "Welcome to Binary Shores Academy" (Binary Shores is just one operation)
- ‚ùå "Binary Shores Academy Curriculum" (It's Agent Academy curriculum)
- ‚ùå "Binary Shores Academy Game" (The game is Agent Academy)

## Teacher Dashboard Requirements

The teacher dashboard should reflect:
1. **Platform branding**: CodeFly logo and colors
2. **Game context**: Agent Academy theming (spy/agent theme)
3. **Mission tracking**: Show student progress through all 8 Agent Academy operations
4. **Proper naming**: Use "Agent Academy" when referring to the game

## Student Experience

Students are:
- Playing the **Agent Academy** game
- On the **CodeFly** platform
- Progressing through **8 operations** across 18 weeks

## Future Expansion

CodeFly will eventually include:
- Agent Academy (Current - Beginner Python)
- [Future Game 2] (Intermediate Web Development)
- [Future Game 3] (Advanced Full-Stack)
- [Future Game 4] (AI/ML Concepts)

## Quick Reference

| Context | Correct Term | NOT |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Platform/Software | CodeFly | Agent Academy, Binary Shores |
| Current Game | Agent Academy | Binary Shores, CodeFly Game |
| Week 1-2 Operation | Binary Shores Academy | Agent Academy Mission 1 |
| Curriculum Name | Agent Academy Curriculum | Binary Shores Curriculum |

- **Binary Shores Academy** = Operation 1 within the game (like Level 1 or Chapter 1)

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### üö® STRICT MODIFICATION POLICY
**ONLY modify what the user EXPLICITLY asks you to modify. NEVER change anything else.**

#### When user says:
- "Update the dashboard styling" ‚Üí ONLY update styling, keep all existing functionality and content
- "Fix this component" ‚Üí ONLY fix the specific issue, don't rewrite the entire component
- "Add a feature to X" ‚Üí ONLY add to X, don't modify other components
- "Make it look like Y" ‚Üí ONLY apply visual styling from Y, preserve all existing functionality

#### FORBIDDEN Actions:
- ‚ùå Replacing entire components when only styling was requested
- ‚ùå Removing existing functionality (tabs, maps, features) unless explicitly told
- ‚ùå Changing file structure or imports unless required for the specific task
- ‚ùå "Improving" code that wasn't mentioned in the request
- ‚ùå Rewriting working code just because you think it could be better

#### REQUIRED Actions:
- ‚úÖ Ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous
- ‚úÖ Preserve ALL existing functionality when making styling changes
- ‚úÖ Use Edit/MultiEdit for targeted changes, not complete rewrites
- ‚úÖ Test that existing features still work after changes

#### If you can't make the requested change without affecting other parts:
**STOP and explain the limitation. Ask for permission before making broader changes.**

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL - MANDATORY

### When Issues Occur, ALWAYS:

1. **FIRST CHECK**: `KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md` - We've solved this before? Use that solution!
2. **FOLLOW PROTOCOL**: Use `TROUBLESHOOTING-PROTOCOL.md` systematically
3. **LOG EVERYTHING**: Document each attempt in the protocol
4. **UPDATE KNOWLEDGE**: Add new solutions to `KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md` after fixing
5. **TRACK AGENTS**: Log all deployed agents in `AGENT-REGISTRY.md`

### Quick Access Files:
- `KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md` - Database of working fixes
- `TROUBLESHOOTING-PROTOCOL.md` - Systematic debugging approach
- `AGENT-REGISTRY.md` - Specialized agent tracking and efficiency metrics

### Efficiency Rules:
1. **NO REPEATED FAILURES** - Check logs before attempting same solution
2. **SPEED IS KEY** - Known issues should be fixed in < 2 minutes
3. **DOCUMENT SUCCESS** - Every new solution goes in KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md
4. **IMPROVE AGENTS** - Update templates when agents aren't fast enough
5. **MEASURE EVERYTHING** - Track resolution times in AGENT-REGISTRY.md
