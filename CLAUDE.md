# CodeFly Project Documentation

## CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTIONS - READ FIRST

### Platform Name: CodeFly ‚úàÔ∏è
- **CodeFly** is the educational platform/software we are building
- This is the product name that appears in all UI, headers, and branding
- CodeFly will eventually host multiple educational games

### Current Game: Black Cipher üéÆ
- **Black Cipher** is the GAME NAME (not Shadow Protocol!)
- Black Cipher is the first game within the CodeFly platform
- The game teaches coding through a spy/agent themed adventure

### Mission Names Within Black Cipher Game:
1. **Shadow Protocol** (Weeks 1-4) - First mission phase
2. **Cipher Command** (Weeks 5-8) - Second mission phase  
3. **Ghost Protocol** (Weeks 9-13) - Third mission phase
4. **Quantum Breach** (Weeks 14-18) - Final mission phase

### Hierarchy Summary:
```
CodeFly (Platform)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Black Cipher (Game)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shadow Protocol (Mission 1)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cipher Command (Mission 2)

## Project Structure

### Repository Name
- Current: `Curriculum-pilot-mvp`
- Should rename to: `codefly-platform`

### Package.json Name
- Current: `coding-pilot-mvp`
- Should be: `codefly`

## UI Text Guidelines

### Correct Usage Examples:
- ‚úÖ "Welcome to CodeFly - Where Coding Takes Flight!"
- ‚úÖ "Black Cipher: Episode 1 - Shadow Protocol"
- ‚úÖ "Begin your Black Cipher training at Binary Shores Academy"
- ‚úÖ "CodeFly presents: Black Cipher"

### Incorrect Usage (AVOID):
- ‚ùå "Welcome to Shadow Protocol" (Shadow Protocol is just one mission)
- ‚ùå "Shadow Protocol Curriculum" (It's Black Cipher curriculum)
- ‚ùå "Shadow Protocol Game" (The game is Black Cipher)

## Teacher Dashboard Requirements

The teacher dashboard should reflect:
1. **Platform branding**: CodeFly logo and colors
2. **Game context**: Black Cipher theming (spy/agent theme)
3. **Mission tracking**: Show student progress through all 4 Black Cipher missions
4. **Proper naming**: Use "Black Cipher" when referring to the game

## Student Experience

Students are:
- Playing the **Black Cipher** game
- On the **CodeFly** platform
- Currently in the **Shadow Protocol** mission (weeks 1-4)

## Future Expansion

CodeFly will eventually include:
- Black Cipher (Current - Beginner Python)
- [Future Game 2] (Intermediate Web Development)
- [Future Game 3] (Advanced Full-Stack)
- [Future Game 4] (AI/ML Concepts)
