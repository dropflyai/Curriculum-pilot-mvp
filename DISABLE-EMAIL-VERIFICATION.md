# üîß How to Disable Email Verification in Supabase

The "Error sending confirmation email" happens because Supabase is trying to send emails but email service isn't configured. Here's how to fix it:

## Quick Fix: Disable Email Confirmation

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fhopjsgiwvquayyvadaw
2. Log in if needed

### Step 2: Disable Email Confirmation
1. Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Providers** under Configuration
3. Click **Email** 
4. Find **"Confirm email"** toggle
5. **Turn it OFF** (toggle should be gray, not green)
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Clear Any Existing Users (Optional)
If you have test users stuck in unconfirmed state:
1. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Delete any test users
3. Try signing up again

## Alternative: Auto-Confirm Users (Better for Development)

If you can't find the toggle or want to keep email confirmation on:

### In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Auto-confirm all new users (development only!)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.auto_confirm_users()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE auth.users
  SET email_confirmed_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = NEW.id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER auto_confirm_users_trigger
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.auto_confirm_users();
```

## Testing After Fix

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter any test email like: test@example.com
4. Password: test123
5. Should create account and auto-sign in without email verification!

## Production Note
‚ö†Ô∏è **For production**, you'll want to:
- Re-enable email confirmation
- Configure a proper email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
- This provides better security and user verification

But for development and testing, disabling email confirmation is perfectly fine!
