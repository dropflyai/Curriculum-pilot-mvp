# TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL STATUS
**SESSION**: DOC-001-2025-09-10  
**PROTOCOL ID**: TSP-Terminal-Resize-2025-09-10  
**AGENT**: Documentation Agent DOC-001  

## PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

### Mission Statement
Systematically debug and resolve terminal resize functionality in BottomPanel.tsx component that remains non-functional despite previous cursor direction fixes.

### Problem Classification
- **Category**: Component Interaction Bug
- **Severity**: HIGH (Core IDE functionality impacted)
- **Type**: Event Handling / State Management Issue
- **Component**: BottomPanel.tsx (Child) + AgentAcademyIDE-Enhanced.tsx (Parent)

## TROUBLESHOOTING PHASES COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Initial Problem Identification ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Identify the root cause of incorrect resize behavior  
**Actions Taken**:
- Located handleMouseDown function in BottomPanel.tsx (lines 150-179)
- Identified incorrect cursor direction behavior
- Analyzed mouse event delta calculations

**Findings**:
- Original code had inverted logic for bottom panel resize
- Dragging up (negative deltaY) should increase height
- Dragging down (positive deltaY) should decrease height

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Root cause identified

### Phase 2: Direction Fix Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Objective**: Correct the mouse movement delta calculation logic  
**Actions Taken**:
- Applied fix to deltaY calculation: `deltaY = e.clientY - startY`
- Applied fix to height calculation: `newHeight = startHeight - deltaY`
- Added proper cursor styling: `document.body.style.cursor = 'row-resize'`
- Added user-select prevention: `document.body.style.userSelect = 'none'`
- Ensured proper cleanup in handleMouseUp

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  // FIXED: Proper delta calculation for bottom panel
  const deltaY = e.clientY - startY
  const newHeight = startHeight - deltaY
  const clampedHeight = Math.max(100, Math.min(600, newHeight))
  onHeightChange(clampedHeight)
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fix applied and deployed

### Phase 3: Post-Fix Verification üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Verify that the direction fix resolves the resize issue  
**Actions Taken**:
- Deployed fix to development server (PORT=3001)
- Tested resize handle interaction
- Observed visual feedback (cursor changes, handle styling)

**Current Findings**:
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Resize functionality still not working
- ‚úÖ Resize handle visual feedback working correctly
- ‚úÖ Mouse cursor changes to row-resize on hover
- ‚úÖ Mouse events are being triggered
- ‚ùå Panel height remains unchanged during drag operations

**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Fix applied but issue persists

## CURRENT TROUBLESHOOTING PHASE

### Phase 4: Root Cause Investigation üîÑ ACTIVE
**Objective**: Determine why resize still fails after direction fix  
**Hypothesis**: Issue may be in callback execution, parent state management, or re-render triggers

#### Investigation Areas (Priority Order):

1. **Callback Verification** üîç NEXT ACTION
   - **Test**: Add console.log before onHeightChange call
   - **Purpose**: Verify if callback is being executed
   - **Expected Output**: Log with clampedHeight values during drag
   - **Implementation**:
     ```typescript
     console.log('Calling onHeightChange with:', clampedHeight)
     onHeightChange(clampedHeight)
     ```

2. **Parent State Update Verification** üîç PENDING
   - **Test**: Add console.log in parent setTerminalHeight function
   - **Purpose**: Confirm parent receives and processes height updates
   - **Expected Output**: Log showing parent state updates
   - **Implementation**:
     ```typescript
     const setTerminalHeight = (newHeight: number) => {
       console.log('Parent received height update:', newHeight)
       setTerminalHeightState(newHeight)
     }
     ```

3. **Re-render Trigger Verification** üîç PENDING
   - **Test**: Monitor height prop changes in BottomPanel
   - **Purpose**: Verify that parent state updates trigger child re-renders
   - **Expected Output**: Component re-render with updated height style
   - **Implementation**: Add useEffect to monitor height prop changes

4. **Event Listener Functionality** üîç PENDING
   - **Test**: Verify mousemove listener attachment and execution
   - **Purpose**: Confirm event handling pipeline is working
   - **Expected Output**: Mouse move events logged during drag

#### Debugging Protocol Steps:

**Step 4.1** - Add Callback Debug Logging ‚è≠Ô∏è IMMEDIATE NEXT
```typescript
const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  const deltaY = e.clientY - startY
  const newHeight = startHeight - deltaY
  const clampedHeight = Math.max(100, Math.min(600, newHeight))
  
  // DEBUG: Log before callback
  console.log('DEBUG: Mouse move detected', { 
    deltaY, 
    newHeight, 
    clampedHeight,
    startY: startY,
    currentY: e.clientY 
  })
  console.log('DEBUG: Calling onHeightChange with:', clampedHeight)
  
  onHeightChange(clampedHeight)
}
```

**Step 4.2** - Add Parent State Debug Logging
```typescript
// In AgentAcademyIDE-Enhanced.tsx
const handleTerminalHeightChange = (newHeight: number) => {
  console.log('DEBUG: Parent received height update:', newHeight)
  console.log('DEBUG: Previous height was:', terminalHeight)
  setTerminalHeight(newHeight)
}
```

**Step 4.3** - Add Re-render Monitoring
```typescript
// In BottomPanel.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('DEBUG: BottomPanel height prop changed to:', height)
}, [height])
```

## POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES MATRIX

| Cause Category | Probability | Investigation Priority | Test Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Callback Not Executing | HIGH | 1 | Console.log before onHeightChange |
| Parent State Not Updating | HIGH | 2 | Console.log in setTerminalHeight |
| Re-render Not Triggered | MEDIUM | 3 | useEffect height monitoring |
| Event Listener Issues | LOW | 4 | Mouse event logging |
| CSS/Style Application | LOW | 5 | DOM inspection |
| Browser Compatibility | LOW | 6 | Cross-browser testing |

## PROTOCOL STATUS SUMMARY

### Completed Phases: 2/6
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Problem Identification 
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Direction Fix Implementation
- üîÑ Phase 3: Post-Fix Verification (Issue persists)
- üîÑ Phase 4: Root Cause Investigation (Active)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 5: Secondary Fix Implementation (Pending)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 6: Final Verification (Pending)

### Current Blocker
Terminal resize functionality remains non-functional despite correct cursor direction logic implementation.

### Next Required Action
Implement callback verification debugging (Step 4.1) to determine if onHeightChange is being executed during mouse drag operations.

### Session Continuity Note
If session crashes during Phase 4, resume with callback debugging implementation. All previous phases are documented and fixes are preserved in the codebase.

**PROTOCOL STATUS**: ACTIVE - Phase 4 debugging required to identify callback execution status.
