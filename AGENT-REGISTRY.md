# ü§ñ AGENT REGISTRY - SPECIALIZED SUB-AGENTS

## Purpose
Track all specialized agents deployed, their effectiveness, and improvements needed. 
**Goal**: Achieve faster problem resolution with each iteration.

## Efficiency Metrics
- **Target Resolution Time**: < 5 minutes for known issues
- **Success Rate Goal**: > 90% first-attempt fixes
- **Learning Rate**: Each agent improves with every deployment

## AGENT DEPLOYMENT TEMPLATE

```typescript
// AGENT TEMPLATE - Copy and customize for new agents
You are a [SPECIFIC TYPE] Specialist Agent.

EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check AGENT-REGISTRY.md for similar agents - don't duplicate effort
2. Check KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md FIRST - apply known fixes immediately (< 30 seconds)
3. If known solution fails, log why it failed for registry update
4. Complete tasks in parallel where possible
5. Report completion time and success/failure

PROJECT: /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly-OS-App-Builder/DropFly-PROJECTS/Curriculum-pilot-mvp

TASK: [Specific problem to solve]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Problem resolved in < 5 minutes
- Solution documented
- No side effects created

RETURN FORMAT:
- Time taken: X minutes
- Success: Yes/No
- Actions performed: [List]
- Issues encountered: [List]  
- Recommended registry updates: [Improvements needed]
```

---

## EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS LOG

### Sept 3, 2025 Analysis:
1. **Problem**: Multiple agents doing similar cache clearing
   - **Solution**: Create single Cache Management Agent
   
2. **Problem**: Agents not checking known solutions first
   - **Solution**: Mandatory KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md check added to template

3. **Problem**: Dev server restarts without production builds
   - **Solution**: Always run `npm run build` before `npm run dev`

4. **Problem**: No agent coordination/communication
   - **Solution**: Use AGENT-REGISTRY.md for status tracking

---

## RECOMMENDED AGENT IMPROVEMENTS

### High Priority:
1. **Unified Build Agent** - Combines cache clearing + rebuild + verification
2. **Smart Diagnostic Agent** - Runs all checks in parallel, identifies issue category
3. **Auto-Fix Agent** - Applies known solutions without human intervention

### Medium Priority:
1. **Performance Monitor Agent** - Tracks resolution times and suggests optimizations
2. **Dependency Manager Agent** - Handles all npm/package issues
3. **Port Manager Agent** - Intelligently manages development ports

### Low Priority:
1. **Documentation Agent** - Auto-updates KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md
2. **Learning Agent** - Analyzes patterns in failures

---

## METRICS TRACKING

### Current Performance:
- **Average Resolution Time**: ~5 minutes
- **First-Attempt Success Rate**: 80%
- **Known Solution Application Rate**: 40% (needs improvement)

### Target Performance (by Sept 10, 2025):
- **Average Resolution Time**: < 2 minutes
- **First-Attempt Success Rate**: > 95%
- **Known Solution Application Rate**: > 90%
