## 🎯 Key Components

### 1. Curriculum Knowledge (`curriculum/lessons.json`)
- **Lesson objectives** and learning outcomes
- **Real-world analogies** for abstract concepts (variables = phone contacts)
- **Interactive examples** with code snippets and explanations
- **Progressive hints** for scaffolded learning
- **Common misconceptions** and how to address them

### 2. Error Support (`student-support/common-errors.json`)
- **SyntaxError** patterns (missing colons, quotes, parentheses)
- **NameError** patterns (undefined variables, typos)
- **TypeError** patterns (string/number confusion)
- **IndentationError** patterns (Python spacing requirements)
- **Student-friendly explanations** with analogies
- **Progressive help levels** (immediate → detailed → teacher alert)

### 3. Intervention Templates (`student-support/intervention-templates.json`)
- **Encouragement messages** for progress and achievements
- **Gentle guidance** for initial confusion
- **Specific technical hints** for code problems
- **Step-by-step help** for significant challenges
- **Emotional support** for frustration and confusion
- **Context awareness** (time of day, session progress, learning streaks)

### 4. Communication Guidelines (`pedagogy/age-appropriate-communication.json`)
- **9th-grade characteristics** (attention span, motivators, challenges)
- **Communication style** (tone, vocabulary, message length)
- **Motivational strategies** (achievement, autonomy, social connection)
- **Cultural awareness** (digital native, generation values, diversity)
- **Red flags** to avoid (condescending tone, outdated references, comparisons)

### 5. Platform Integration (`platform-integration/codefly-features.json`)
- **Code execution** capabilities and limitations (Pyodide)
- **Progress tracking** systems (Supabase real-time)
- **UI components** and interaction points
- **Teacher coordination** for escalation and handoff
- **Gamification integration** (XP, badges, streaks)

## 🚀 Usage

### For AI Tutor Development
The knowledge base provides structured data that an AI tutor can use to:

1. **Understand student context** from lesson progress and error patterns
2. **Provide appropriate responses** based on learning stage and difficulty
3. **Escalate to teachers** when human intervention is needed
4. **Maintain consistency** with CodeFly's educational approach

### For Teachers and Educators
Access the knowledge base through the **Teacher Portal → AI Tutor KB** interface to:

- **Review and edit** intervention templates
