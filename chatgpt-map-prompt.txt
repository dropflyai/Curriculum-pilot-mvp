**ChatGPT Prompt for CodeFly Quest Map Design**

I need you to create a detailed description for a 2D quest map graphic that will be used in a coding education platform called "CodeFly Academy" for 9th-grade students learning Python programming.

**REQUIRED GRAPHIC SPECIFICATIONS:**

**Map Type:** 2D illustrated quest map in a fantasy/adventure game style
**Dimensions:** 1200x800 pixels, landscape orientation
**File Format:** PNG with transparent background for UI overlay elements

**VISUAL STYLE:**
- Fantasy adventure game aesthetic (similar to World of Warcraft quest maps)
- Hand-drawn illustrated style with clean, modern vector graphics
- Bright, engaging colors suitable for teenagers
- Professional quality but approachable and fun

**MAP LAYOUT - PROGRESS PATH:**
The map must show a clear learning progression path with 8 connected mission points arranged in a logical trail across a fantasy landscape. The path should guide the eye from left to right, then down, creating a natural "S" curve progression.

**8 MISSION LOCATIONS (in order):**

1. **"CodeFly Academy"** - Starting castle/school building (LEFT SIDE)
   - Status: COMPLETED (green glow, checkmark badge)
   - Icon: Castle/academy building with CodeFly flag

2. **"Variable Storage"** - Data warehouse (UPPER CENTER-LEFT) 
   - Status: COMPLETED (green glow, checkmark badge)
   - Icon: Warehouse/storage facility with data symbols

3. **"Logic Tower"** - Decision-making tower (UPPER CENTER)
   - Status: IN PROGRESS (blue glow, half-filled progress ring)
   - Icon: Tall tower with branching paths/decision symbols

4. **"Loop Systems"** - Automated facility (UPPER RIGHT)
   - Status: LOCKED (gray/dim, lock symbol)
   - Icon: Factory with spinning gears/circular arrows

5. **"Function Lab"** - Research laboratory (RIGHT SIDE)
   - Status: LOCKED (gray/dim, lock symbol)  
   - Icon: Science laboratory with function f(x) symbols

6. **"Array Center"** - Data organization facility (LOWER RIGHT)
   - Status: LOCKED (gray/dim, lock symbol)
   - Icon: Grid-like building with array brackets []

7. **"Object Studio"** - Design workshop (LOWER CENTER)
   - Status: LOCKED (gray/dim, lock symbol)
   - Icon: Creative studio with {} object symbols

8. **"Database Ops"** - Secure data vault (LOWER LEFT)
   - Status: LOCKED (gray/dim, lock symbol)
   - Icon: Fortress-like building with database cylinder symbols

**PROGRESS PATH REQUIREMENTS:**
- Dotted/dashed trail connecting all 8 locations in numerical order
- Path should be clearly visible and guide the eye naturally
- Completed sections of path are bright/glowing
- Locked sections are dim/faded
- Current mission has pulsing/animated trail leading to it

**INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:**
- Each mission location needs a circular progress medallion/badge overlay
- Mission numbers (1-8) clearly displayed on each medallion
- Status indicators: âœ… for completed, âš¡ for current, ðŸ”’ for locked
- Hover zones should be obvious for clickable areas

**BACKGROUND LANDSCAPE:**
- Fantasy terrain with varied environments (forests, mountains, water, cities)
- Should support the theme of each mission location
- Not too busy - must not compete with the mission markers
- Cohesive color palette that works with UI overlays

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- All text must be readable at 1200px width
- Mission markers must be clearly distinguishable at all zoom levels
- Color palette should work on dark theme backgrounds
- Leave space for UI overlays (progress bars, student info, etc.)

**INSPIRATION REFERENCES:**
Think "Zelda: Breath of the Wild" map style meets "Khan Academy" educational design - professional but engaging for teenagers.

Please provide a detailed description of this quest map that I can use with an AI image generator to create the perfect learning progression graphic for our CodeFly Academy platform.
