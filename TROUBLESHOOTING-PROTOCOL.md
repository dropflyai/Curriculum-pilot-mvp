2. Verify the current state of the system
3. Test the exact user scenario they're reporting
4. Document what IS working vs. what ISN'T working

## RULES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PROTOCOL

1. **NEVER give up until problem is actually solved**
2. **ALWAYS check KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md first**
3. **ALWAYS verify current state first (Step 0)**
4. **DOCUMENT every step with timestamps**
5. **TEST every theory immediately**  
6. **LOG all commands and results**
7. **VERIFY the solution actually works**
8. **UPDATE knowledge base when done**

## WHEN TO USE THIS PROTOCOL

- User explicitly asks for "troubleshooting protocol"
- User says "enter troubleshooting mode" 
- User is frustrated with repeated failures
- System is not working as expected despite multiple attempts

## EXIT CONDITIONS

- âœ… Problem is actually solved and verified working
- âœ… User confirms the issue is resolved
- âœ… Solution is documented in KNOWN-SOLUTIONS.md
- âœ… No other conditions allow exit from protocol
