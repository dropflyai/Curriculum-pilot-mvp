# Test Cases: Games → Mission-HQ Flow

## Overview
Critical user flow test cases for the games page "Start Learning" button that should navigate to Mission HQ. This flow has failed **3 times** and requires comprehensive testing to prevent regression.

## Critical Flow Description
1. User visits `/games` (without authentication)
2. User clicks "Start Learning" button for Agent Academy
3. System should redirect to `/mission-hq` 
4. Mission HQ should load properly (with demo auth or redirect to auth)

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue**: After git restores, middleware.ts reverts `/games` and `/mission-hq` from public to protected routes
- **Result**: "Start Learning" button redirects to `/auth` instead of `/mission-hq`
- **Frequency**: Occurred 3 times (Sept 6, 7, and recurring)
