# üìä Teacher Dashboard - Lesson 1 & 2 Monitoring Production Checklist

## üéØ Current Focus: Make Lessons 1 & 2 Monitoring Production Ready

### üìö Lesson Details
- **Lesson 1**: `week-01` - Binary Shores Academy (AI Classifier)
- **Lesson 2**: `week-02` - Variable Village Outpost (Python Magic 8-Ball)

---

## ‚úÖ Already Completed
- [x] Database schema with real-time subscriptions
- [x] WebSocket implementation in progress-tracking.ts
- [x] Real-time hooks (useRealtimeProgress)
- [x] Teacher dashboard integration
- [x] Student progress tracking initialization

---

## üî¥ Critical - Must Fix for Production

### 1. **Lesson-Specific Monitoring**
- [ ] Verify lesson IDs match between frontend and database
  - Currently using: `week-01` and `week-02`
  - Check if students are actually creating progress records
- [ ] Test with actual lesson navigation flow
- [ ] Ensure progress tracking triggers when students start lessons

### 2. **Real-Time Data Flow**
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection with production Supabase
- [ ] Verify real-time updates appear within 2 seconds
- [ ] Test with 5+ simultaneous students
- [ ] Handle connection drops gracefully

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- [ ] Ensure all student actions are logged:
  - [ ] Lesson start
  - [ ] Section completion (Learn, Code, Quiz, Submit)
  - [ ] Code executions with error tracking
  - [ ] Quiz submissions with scores
  - [ ] Help requests
- [ ] Verify no data loss during disconnections

### 4. **Teacher Dashboard Display**
- [ ] Shows correct lesson titles (not IDs)
- [ ] Displays real student names (not "Unknown Student")
- [ ] Updates progress bars accurately
- [ ] Shows time spent correctly
- [ ] Highlights struggling students (3+ errors or stuck 20+ min)

## üü° High Priority - Should Complete

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- [ ] Test with 30+ students simultaneously
- [ ] Optimize database queries (add proper indexes)
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders

### 6. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Add try/catch blocks in all async functions
- [ ] Show user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Log errors to monitoring service
- [ ] Fallback to cached data when offline

### 7. **Testing Suite**
- [ ] Create test student accounts
- [ ] Write automated tests for progress tracking
- [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Edge case testing (network issues, etc.)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Student Flow Test**
   ```
   1. Login as student
   2. Navigate to Lesson 1 (Binary Shores Academy)
   3. Complete each section
   4. Verify teacher dashboard shows progress
   5. Repeat for Lesson 2
   ```

2. **Teacher Monitoring Test**
   ```
   1. Open teacher dashboard
   2. Have 3 students start Lesson 1
   3. Verify real-time updates appear
   4. Test help request alerts
   5. Check stuck student detection
   ```

3. **Error Simulation Test**
   ```
   1. Disconnect internet briefly
   2. Verify data persists locally
   3. Reconnect and verify sync
   4. Force errors in student code
   5. Verify error tracking works
   ```

## üìù Code Verification Tasks

### Files to Check:
- [ ] `src/lib/progress-tracking.ts` - Lesson ID mapping correct
- [ ] `src/app/teacher/page.tsx` - Displays lesson names properly
- [ ] `src/app/lesson/[id]/page.tsx` - Tracks progress on mount
- [ ] `src/hooks/useRealtimeProgress.ts` - Handles all event types

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check if students have progress records
SELECT * FROM student_progress 
WHERE lesson_id IN ('week-01', 'week-02')
ORDER BY last_activity DESC;

-- Check recent activities
SELECT * FROM student_activities
WHERE lesson_id IN ('week-01', 'week-02')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Check students needing help
SELECT * FROM student_progress
WHERE needs_help = TRUE
OR (status = 'in_progress' AND last_activity < NOW() - INTERVAL '20 minutes');
```

## üöÄ Quick Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Ensure Lesson Tracking on Start
```typescript
// In src/app/lesson/[id]/page.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (user && lessonId) {
    trackLessonStart(user.id, user.name, lessonId, lessonTitle)
  }
}, [user, lessonId])
```

### Fix 2: Map Lesson IDs to Titles
```typescript
// In teacher dashboard
const lessonTitleMap = {
  'week-01': 'Binary Shores Academy',
  'week-02': 'Variable Village Outpost'
}
```

### Fix 3: Add Connection Status Check
```typescript
// In useRealtimeProgress.ts
const checkConnection = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase.from('student_progress').select('count')
  setIsConnected(!error)
}
```

## üìä Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Lesson 1 & 2 monitoring is production-ready when:**
1. Teacher sees real-time updates within 2 seconds
2. All student actions are tracked accurately
3. No data loss during normal usage
4. System handles 30+ concurrent students
5. Error states are handled gracefully
6. Students needing help are highlighted
7. Progress percentages are accurate
8. Time tracking is precise

---

## üéØ Today's Priority Order:
1. Fix lesson ID mapping issues
2. Test real-time data flow
3. Verify student progress creation
4. Test with multiple students
5. Add error handling
6. Performance optimization
