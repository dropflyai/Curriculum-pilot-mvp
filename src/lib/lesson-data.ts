        content: `Variables in Python are like containers that store data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information.

In Python, you create a variable by simply giving it a name and assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=).

Here are some examples:
â€¢ name = "Alice" (stores text/string)
â€¢ age = 15 (stores a number/integer)
â€¢ height = 5.6 (stores a decimal number/float)
â€¢ is_student = True (stores a True/False value/boolean)

Variable names should be descriptive and follow these rules:
â€¢ Start with a letter or underscore
â€¢ Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
â€¢ Cannot contain spaces or special characters
â€¢ Cannot be Python keywords (like 'if', 'for', 'while', etc.)

Good variable names: student_name, total_score, is_complete
Bad variable names: x, data, temp, 123name`

A Magic 8-Ball is a toy that gives random answers to yes-or-no questions. When you shake it, a random response appears in a little window.

Our digital version will:
1. Ask the user to enter a question
2. Generate a random response from a list of possible answers
3. Display the answer to the user
4. Allow them to ask another question

This project will teach you:
â€¢ How to get input from users
â€¢ How to work with lists
â€¢ How to generate random choices
â€¢ How to use loops to repeat actions
â€¢ How to make your programs interactive

Let's start building!`
